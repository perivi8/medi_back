# Email Network Connectivity Issue Fix

## Problem
The email service was failing with the error:
```
Network connectivity issue: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable. 
The system cannot reach the Gmail SMTP server.
```

This is a common issue when deploying applications to platforms like Render where SMTP ports (587, 465, 25) are often blocked for security reasons.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Robust Email Service
Created a new `robust_email_service.py` that implements multiple fallback mechanisms:

1. **Network Detection**: Checks network connectivity before attempting SMTP
2. **SMTP Service**: Tries Gmail SMTP if network is available
3. **HTTP Fallback**: Uses HTTP-based email services (SendGrid, Mailgun) if SMTP fails
4. **Local Storage**: Stores emails locally if all services fail

### 2. Key Features

#### Network Awareness
- Tests connectivity to Gmail SMTP server before attempting to send
- Detects network issues and provides appropriate error messages
- Automatically switches to fallback mechanisms

#### Multiple Fallback Layers
1. **Primary**: Gmail SMTP (if network available)
2. **Secondary**: HTTP-based services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
3. **Tertiary**: Local storage with manual sending option

#### Graceful Error Handling
- Specific handling for network errors (Errno 101)
- Local storage of emails when sending fails
- Clear user feedback about what happened

### 3. Updated Email Endpoint
Modified the `/send-prediction-email` endpoint in `app.py` to use the robust email service instead of the direct SMTP service.

## How It Works

1. When an email request is received, the robust service first checks if the network is available
2. If network is available, it attempts to send via Gmail SMTP
3. If SMTP fails due to network issues, it automatically tries HTTP-based services
4. If all services fail, it stores the email locally in `email_reports.json`
5. Users are informed that their report is saved and will be sent when connectivity is restored

## Environment Configuration

The system now works with multiple email service configurations:

### Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended)
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
```

### Option 2: Mailgun
```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key_here
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_domain
```

### Option 3: Gmail SMTP (May not work on all platforms)
```bash
GMAIL_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_robust_email_service.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure emails are handled properly
2. **User Experience**: Clear feedback when issues occur
3. **Data Safety**: Emails stored locally if sending fails
4. **Platform Compatibility**: Works on Render and other platforms with SMTP restrictions
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports direct SMTP when available

## Files Modified

1. `app.py` - Updated email endpoint to use robust service
2. `robust_email_service.py` - New robust email service implementation
3. `test_robust_email_service.py` - Test script for verification

This fix ensures that email delivery issues due to network connectivity problems are handled gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms.
