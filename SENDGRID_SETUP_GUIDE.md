# SendGrid Setup Guide for Render Deployment

## 🎯 Problem
Render blocks SMTP ports (25, 465, 587) which prevents direct Gmail SMTP connections. This causes timeout errors when sending emails.

## ✅ Solution
Use SendGrid's HTTP API which works on Render since it uses standard HTTP ports.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account
1. Go to [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day)
3. Complete email verification

### Step 2: Create API Key
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name it "MediCare-Render"
4. Select **Restricted Access**
5. Under **Mail Send**, select **Full Access**
6. Click **Create & View**
7. Copy the API key (you won't see it again)

### Step 3: Add to Render Environment
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add a new environment variable:
   ```
   Key: SENDGRID_API_KEY
   Value: [your copied API key]
   ```
5. Remove or keep these (fallback):
   ```
   GMAIL_EMAIL=gokrishna98@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=lwkvzupqanxvafrm
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Sender Identity
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
3. Fill in your details:
   - From Email: gokrishna98@gmail.com
   - From Name: MediCare+ Platform
   - Reply To: gokrishna98@gmail.com
4. Click **Create**

### Step 5: Redeploy
1. Commit and push any changes to trigger redeployment
2. Or manually redeploy from Render dashboard

## 🧪 Test Email Functionality
After deployment:
1. Go to your frontend
2. Make a prediction with an email address
3. Click "Email Report"
4. Check inbox (and spam folder)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If emails still don't work:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify SendGrid API key is correct
3. Check sender authentication in SendGrid
4. Test with different email addresses

### Common Issues:
- **"Permission denied"**: API key doesn't have Mail Send access
- **"Sender not verified"**: Complete sender authentication in SendGrid
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: You've hit the free tier limit (100 emails/day)

## 🔄 Fallback Options

If SendGrid doesn't work for you:

### Option 1: Mailgun
1. Sign up at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
2. Get API key and domain
3. Add to Render environment:
   ```
   MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
   MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
   ```

### Option 2: Keep Gmail with Timeout Controls
The system will fall back to Gmail with strict timeout controls:
- Connection timeout: 15 seconds
- Send timeout: 30 seconds
- Total timeout: 45 seconds

## 📊 Benefits of SendGrid
